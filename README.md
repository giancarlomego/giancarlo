# Hi, I'm Giancarlo Gordillo
Iâ€™m a Senior Marketing Program Manager with over 10 years of experience in the tech industry, specializing in Open Source, Developer Relations, and global go-to-market strategy.

Currently at CloudLinux and TuxCare, I lead the strategy and execution of developer-focused programs across the Americas, EMEA, and Asia.

I work cross-functionally with product, engineering, DevRel, sales, and marketing teams to deliver high-impact programs that align with KPIs and drive measurable ROI.

My focus is on engaging developer communities, building strategic partnerships, and identifying the right events, speaking opportunities, and marketing tactics for technical audiences. I develop ICP-based evaluation frameworks, tailor activation plans to specific attendee profiles, and ensure successful execution across channels.

Core Focus Areas:

Developer-focused event strategy and execution

Open Source ecosystem engagement and growth

Partner and DevRel marketing programs

Global GTM strategy for technical products

Based in Spain and working with global teams.
